                  My background is in service. <br/> My drive is to help and to understand. And of course, to have fun. <br/>
                  In 2020, after seven years working as a bicycle mechanic, I 
                  completed a 16 week full-time software development

                  course by App Academy</a>. Check out these projects to see what I can do!
                  <br/>I'm thrilled with what I learned. If you're thinking about doing a bootcamp, I wholeheartedly recommend App Academy.

                        I've loved board games since childhood, but only in 2020 did I discover the king. <br/>
                        I was inspired by  
                        <a href="https://www.alphagomovie.com/" class="link" target="blank">this documentary</a> 
                        to pick it up and to create my own playable version. <br/>
                        Sadly, the process didn't improve my game, but I learned so much about JavaScript and gosh it's amazing.

                        I am most proud of this project for several reasons. The idea is awesome and we executed: A global news app with a globe as the primary interface. 
                        The technical challenges were intense and gratifying. Being part of a high-performing team, following through with a tight deadline, and learning to hook up our app 
                        to external news APIs felt like the real deal. I can't wait to get started in the industry.

                <section>
                  I've been fascinated by tools and technology as long as I can remember. My father fed my interests with subscriptions to magazines like Popular Science,
                  which I devoured every month, thrilled by the mind-blowing advance of technology and the rise of Tesla.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  Eager to grow up, I got my first job at a bicycle retail store at 14 years old. Here I discovered a life of learning under direct mentors, working with my hands, 
                  and providing creative technical solutions that improve lives. There is no better feeling to me than receiving the gratitude and trust of someone to whom I've provided 
                  a real and personalized service.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  But this is not limited to face-to-face connections. I had the same gratitude and trust for the quality parts distributors and manufacturer warranty offices that 
                  I worked with on a daily basis, and I learned the value of businesses that put their clients first and invest in their technology.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                  In 2020, after seven years as a bicycle mechanic, I decided to go to App Academy and finally learn to be a software engineer. I'm thrilled to have the skills I've 
                  wanted my whole life, and I cannot wait to dedicate my time and effort to building the incredible technology that will inspire kids like me.
